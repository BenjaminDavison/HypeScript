##############HYPEME BATCH DOWNLOADER##############
Hypme.py is a Python script to bulk download songs from hype machine.


Steps to use:

1 - Make sure you have Python installed.

2- Make sure you have Sqlite3 installed.

3- Create a sqlite3 table:

	3.1 example: "$ sqlite3 songs.db "CREATE TABLE songs (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, key TEXT);"

Note: 1 & 2 should be out of the box on a Mac.

3 - Open hypeme.py and change the following:

AREA_TO_SCRAPE: Set this variable to what you'd like to scrape. i.e. popular or a username.

NUMBER_OF_PAGES: Number of pages to scrape. For initial download you can set this number really high and later just cron job the script set to 1.

FOLDER: Set this to the folder you'd like to store the songs to.

DB_FILE: Set this to the database file you've made earlier.
